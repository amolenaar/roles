RoleType metaclass

.. autoclass:: RoleType
   :members:

Ways to apply roles
-------------------

There are basically 2 ways to apply a role to an instance. The first one is
to manipulate the instance's class (this is the default) and the second is
to proxy the object.

.. autofunction:: instance

.. autofunction:: clone

Using roles in a context
------------------------

Roles are played in a context. The ``roles.context`` module provides a
means to access the context from within your roles. Use this to make your
role's code simpler and more readable.

.. module:: roles.context

.. autofunction:: context

.. autofunction:: in_context


Generic roles
-------------

As an (non-DCI) extension it is possible to create role implementations tailored
for specific objects.

Although this may clutter the clear and readable ways provided by DCI, for
specific tasks it may help. Use it wisely.

.. module:: roles.factory

.. autofunction:: assignto
