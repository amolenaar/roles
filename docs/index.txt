Python roles module
===================

*Library for Role based development*

``Roles`` provides a Pythonic implementation of the DCI (Data Context Interaction) paradigm
(http://www.artima.com/articles/dci_vision.html).

Roles allow you to assign and revoke behaviour on a per-instance basis. This defines the big difference with mixins, which are assigned at class level.

A role has a special meaning in a context (imagine you want to do a money transfer: in this context you'll need 2 accounts, a source and a destination account). The roles module provides a simple implementation for defining contexts.

Roles can be assigned and revoked. Multiple roles can be applied to an
instance. Revocation can happen in any particular order.
